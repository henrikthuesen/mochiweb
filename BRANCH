OSX-Reloader

On OSX, it seems that the timer:send_interval/2 will try to catch lost
ticks from when the system was sleeping (suspended). This will produce
high CPU usage for a while after resume.

To counteract this, this branch modifies the reloader.erl in such a
was that no fixed schedule is set up. Instead each iteration of the
reloader will schedule a new one-time execution (send a one-time
message to the process). Therefore no more that one tick is "skipped"
when the system goes to sleep and resumes.

The change is only tested on my system (Mac OS X 10.7.5) with Erlang
R16B.
